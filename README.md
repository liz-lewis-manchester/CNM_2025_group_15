This project simulates the evolution of pollutant concentration in a river using numerical methods learnt in CIVL20471. 
### Description
This simulation models the pollutant concentration at any time and point in the model domain with the following advection equation:
```math
$$\frac{\partial \theta}{\partial t} = -U\frac{\partial \theta}{\partial x}$$
```
where:
- θ = pollutant concentration (µg/m³)
- t = time (s)
- x = distance along the river (m)
- U = velocity (ms⁻¹)

This code allows users to input their own model domain, resolution, and the initial conditions of the simulation.
utilises functions that carry out the finite difference method w/ partial equations
can read initial conditions (and interpolates between the data), whilst handling the boundary conditions
user can simulate with their own model domain and resolution
