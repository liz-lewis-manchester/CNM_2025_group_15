This file contains the code to impose a random 10% pertruabtion onto the velocity profile.
The simulation is run again after the pertubation is added.
A comparison in the form of a chart will be produced.

Run this after adding advection solver.

Files:
#advection equation is (dtheta)/(dt)+u(dtheta)/(dx)=0
#CFL number = max(|u|)*dt/dx

This script:
    - Applies a 10% random perturbation to velocity
    - Runs the perturbed simulation
    - Plots and saves comparisons

Create seeded random pertuabtions so results are reproducible

np.random.seed(42) 
eps = 0.10
noise = eps * np.random.randn(N)
U_pertubed = U * (1 + noise)
